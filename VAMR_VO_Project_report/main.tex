    \item Interesting things that went right
    \item What might explain or be the solution to the things that went wrong
    \item Behaviour of additional things we implemented
    Note that having implemented an additional feature which degrades the quality of your VO pipeline will be accepted and valued as long as i) the implemented feature is properly motivated and described, and ii) an analysis showing the effect of your additional feature is provided in the report. If the additional feature degrades the quality, provide both a screencast with additional feature enabled and additional feature disabled.
