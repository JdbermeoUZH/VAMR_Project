1. Pick frames to use for initializing the 3d keypoints
	- for Kitti they recommend 1 and 3
	
2. Identify features in both frames	
	- Use either corners (Harris or Shi-Tomasi)
		- With Intensity patch matching
		- HOG descriptor
	- SIFT
	- For the 0.5: LIFT 
	
	
3. Match the frames	to get the point correspondences
	- Choose a distance/similarity metric
	- Use pairwise comparisson
	
	- Use KLT (exercise 8)
	
4. Estimate the point cloud of the landmarks
	- Calculate the fundamental matrix (the intrinsic of the cameras are not given)
		- Use 8 point ransac (estimateFundamentalMatrix)
		- For the 0.5: 5 point ransac, 1 point ransac + 5 point ransac
	
5. Optimize the estimated fundamental matrix with bundle correction (check if already done)
		- over the reprojection error
