## Running the pipeline

First of all check out the branch ”continuous operation test” from https://github.com/JdbermeoUZH/VAMR Project/.

Before you call the "main.m" function look over the file 'setup/LoadHyperParams.m' and change the used feature detection algorithm to you liking (featDetec algo). Please run it on Matlab2021b.

If you only want to test it on a subset of the total dataset set (test) to true and specify the number of images to use (test range). The used dataset is specified in 'setup/loadLoadFilePaths'. Please consider the comments for valid hyperparameter inputs.
