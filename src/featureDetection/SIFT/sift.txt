Short descrition on SIFT implementation and workflow:

1. Feature extraction
   - Build Img Pyramid		☑️
   - Blur it			☑️
   - Difference of gaussians	☑️
   - Extract keypoints		☑️

2. Descriptor

3. Feature matching
   - is this part of the SIFT algo? or can we do a custom one here?

Unanswerd questions/TODOs (for me personally):
   - how does feature extraction exactly work?
   - I get super confused with the pyramid matrix dimensions
   	-> if time dive into this and get lost in higher dimensions 🍁🍁🍁
   - I still don't really get the usecase for parfor (anyways thats a performance thing and doesn't count for the grade 🙄)
   - I didn't get too much in the code for the descriptor for now so keep that in mind
