%% Calculate the number of frames to skip before performing both position
% measurements and new keypoint acceptance

% inputs:
% - 3D positions of the keypoints calculated in bootstrapping or
% prevous iteration as seen by the older keyframe.
% [3,N] (if not, modify lines 65,

% - displacement in distance and angle between cameras
% number of frame changes from keypoint i to i+1
% xsz,ysz the dimensions of the frames in pixels
% img0 the initial keyframe (for dimension purposes)
% K the calibration matrix

% Output:
% - The expected number of frames to skip before finding a keyframe
% - Either: the minimum distances needed between keyframes, either parallel
% or perpendicular to the camera plane
%   Or: the minimum angle formed by (keyframe i, mean keypoint,
% keyframe i+1) and the minimum distance of travel perpendicular to the
% camera plane

% Note: A separate function, CheckIfKeyframe, needs to actually compare
% each new frame against the result of this function. It merely needs to
% check how many frames have passed since the last Baseline.m and trigger
% ValidateKeyframe once the right number of frame changes has been reached.

% Another function, ValidateKeyframe, is necessary to ensure stability. It
% must identify unexpected motion (we moved to little or too much between
% keyframes, or too few keypoints were matched between keyframes i and
% i+1). ValidateKeyframe can instruct the program to instead select an
% earlier or later frame as a keyframe as needed.

%The idea is to create a triangle between the second current keyframe, the
% minimum sidestep length and the minimum forward travel, then copy it by
% symmetry on both sides and front and back. This whole diamond around the
% keyframe would be judged too close to the current frame to be worthy of
% studying in pure translation

% for homogenization, the older current keyframe i (regardless of if i+1 is
% to the left) dictates the origin and axes, if they are necessary

%This function should also verify that sufficiently many keypoints remain
%in view by the time we reach the next keyframe
